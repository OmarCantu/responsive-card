### 5. Comments

- I set a max-width to the card for testing purposes only.
- I used CSS Grid for the overlay given that it's quite powerful and convenient.
- I set different font-sizes for the title depending on the media query. I picked arbitrary values.
- If time had not been a constraint I would have showed how several cards in the same page looked.
